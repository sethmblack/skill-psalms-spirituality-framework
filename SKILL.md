# Psalms Spirituality Framework

A framework for understanding life seasons and faith journeys through Walter Brueggemann's interpretation of the Psalms: seasons of settledness (orientation), crisis (disorientation), and surprising gift (new orientation). This framework validates the full range of human experience in faith and addresses the church's dangerous suppression of lament.

## The Core Principle

"Human life consists in moves 'from' and 'to,' of disengagement and reengagement, of breaking off and rediscovering... The Psalms are profoundly significant in a new way. They are helpful because they express the depths of human experience and because they do so in a way that is theologically informed."
— Walter Brueggemann, *The Message of the Psalms*

Life is not static. Faith is not static. We move through seasons: times when everything makes sense, times when the world falls apart, and times when we are surprised by gift and newness. The Psalms speak to all three. But the church has largely suppressed one of them - disorientation - and in doing so has made faith thin, unable to speak to suffering, and disconnected from real life.

---

## The Foundation

### The Problem: Suppressed Disorientation

American Christianity has largely eliminated lament from its vocabulary:
- Worship services require everyone to be fine
- Praise is mandatory; complaint is discouraged
- The "honest" psalms - the ones with anger, accusation, despair - are rarely read
- We move directly from orientation to orientation, as if crisis never happens
- When people suffer, they find no language for their experience in church

**The result:** Faith cannot hold real suffering. People in crisis feel alone, faithless, abandoned. The church offers therapy instead of theology, adjustment instead of transformation. And when disorientation comes - as it always does - people have no spiritual resources.

### The Solution: The Full Psalter

Brueggemann proposes that we take the Psalms seriously as a guide to the full range of human experience before God. The Psalms show us:

1. **Orientation** - Life is ordered; God is good; everything makes sense
2. **Disorientation** - Life has collapsed; God seems absent; nothing makes sense
3. **New Orientation** - Surprising gift; God has acted; we are restored but transformed

All three are necessary. All three are faithful. The movement through them is the movement of genuine spiritual life.

---

## The Three Seasons

### Season 1: Orientation

**Life Situation:**
- Settled, stable, things make sense
- Life is working according to expectation
- God is present and dependable
- The world is ordered and good

**Psalms of Orientation:**
- **Hymns of Praise:** Psalms 8, 33, 103, 104, 145
- **Creation Psalms:** The world is ordered, beautiful, sustained by God
- **Torah Psalms:** Psalm 1, 19, 119 - the law brings blessing
- **Wisdom Psalms:** The righteous prosper, the wicked perish

**Theological Mood:**
- Gratitude and trust
- Confidence in order
- Security in God's goodness
- Life has meaning and purpose

**Characteristic Language:**
- "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want"
- "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me"
- "The heavens declare the glory of God"
- "Happy are those whose way is blameless"

**The Function:**
Orientation psalms voice what most people feel in seasons of settledness. They are not naive - they know another season exists - but they speak from the experience of coherence. Faith in this season is comfortable, confident, grateful.

**The Danger:**
When orientation becomes the only acceptable posture, faith becomes thin. We cannot acknowledge when things fall apart. We force cheerfulness on the suffering. We make honesty a sign of faithlessness.

---

### Season 2: Disorientation

**Life Situation:**
- Crisis has come: loss, illness, betrayal, death, injustice
- The ordered world has collapsed
- God seems absent, silent, or hostile
- Nothing makes sense anymore

**Psalms of Disorientation:**
- **Individual Laments:** Psalms 13, 22, 38, 39, 88
- **Communal Laments:** Psalms 44, 74, 79, 80
- **Imprecatory Psalms:** Psalms 109, 137 (the "cursing" psalms)
- **Psalms of Abandonment:** "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"

**Theological Mood:**
- Anguish and protest
- Anger - even at God
- Abandonment and isolation
- Accusation and complaint
- Raw, unfiltered pain

**Characteristic Language:**
- "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
- "How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever?"
- "I am weary with my crying; my throat is parched"
- "You have put me in the depths of the pit"
- "By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down and wept"

**The Function:**
Disorientation psalms give voice to suffering. They permit - even demand - honesty with God. They rage, weep, accuse, and question. They do not resolve quickly. Some (Psalm 88) do not resolve at all.

This is not faithlessness. This IS faith - faith that dares to bring the full self before God, faith that refuses the pretense that everything is fine, faith that believes God can handle our honesty.

**The Gift:**
- Permission to grieve
- Language for what feels unspeakable
- Solidarity with all who suffer
- Refusal to pretend
- Keeping relationship with God even in darkness

**The Danger of Suppression:**
When disorientation is suppressed:
- Suffering people feel alone and faithless
- The church has nothing to say to real pain
- Faith becomes superficial optimism
- God becomes too small to hold our rage
- We cannot move to genuine new orientation

---

### Season 3: New Orientation

**Life Situation:**
- Surprising gift after crisis
- Rescue, healing, restoration - but transformed
- God has acted in ways we could not produce
- We are not the same as before orientation

**Psalms of New Orientation:**
- **Thanksgiving Psalms:** Psalms 30, 34, 40, 138
- **Declarative Praise:** "I waited patiently for the Lord; he inclined to me and heard my cry"
- **Testimony Psalms:** Telling what God has done

**Theological Mood:**
- Wonder and amazement
- Gratitude deeper than before
- Testimony to God's saving acts
- Joy that has passed through sorrow

**Characteristic Language:**
- "He lifted me out of the pit, out of the miry clay"
- "Weeping may linger for the night, but joy comes with the morning"
- "You have turned my mourning into dancing"
- "I waited patiently for the Lord; he inclined to me"

**The Function:**
New orientation is NOT returning to the old orientation. It is transformed life, marked by disorientation, surprised by grace. The joy of new orientation is deeper because it knows the darkness. The praise is more textured because it has passed through lament.

**Critical Distinction:**
- Orientation says: "God is good" (naive affirmation)
- New orientation says: "God is good" (hard-won testimony through suffering)
- They sound the same but they are not the same

**The Gift:**
- Joy that takes suffering seriously
- Testimony that speaks to real experience
- Faith tested and deepened
- Genuine transformation, not mere recovery

---

## The Framework in Practice

### Step 1: Locate the Season

**Ask:**
- Where is this person/community in the movement?
- Are they in settled orientation?
- Have they entered disorientation?
- Are they experiencing surprise of new orientation?

**Listen for:**
- Orientation: "Everything is fine," confident faith, gratitude
- Disorientation: Pain, confusion, anger, absence of God, "Why?"
- New orientation: Wonder, amazement, testimony, "God has done..."

**Warning:** Do not rush someone through the seasons. Disorientation takes as long as it takes. Forcing cheerfulness on a person in disorientation is spiritual violence.

### Step 2: Validate the Season

**For Orientation:**
- Affirm the goodness of gratitude and settled faith
- But gently note that other seasons exist
- The psalms of orientation are not naive - they coexist with lament

**For Disorientation:**
- This is the crucial intervention
- Validate that disorientation is faithful, not faithless
- The lament psalms model honest speech to God
- God can handle rage, accusation, despair
- You do not need to pretend
- Introduce the lament psalms as permission and language

**For New Orientation:**
- Receive the testimony with wonder
- Note the difference from naive orientation
- Encourage sharing the story - testimony serves others

### Step 3: Provide Language

**The psalms give words when we have none.**

For someone in disorientation:
- Read Psalm 13: "How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever?"
- Read Psalm 22: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
- Read Psalm 88: The psalm that does not resolve
- Say: "These words are in the Bible. They are permitted. They are holy."

For someone entering new orientation:
- Read Psalm 30: "You have turned my mourning into dancing"
- Read Psalm 40: "He lifted me out of the pit"
- Say: "What has God done? Tell the story."

### Step 4: Address the Church's Failure

**If appropriate, name the problem:**
- The church has suppressed lament
- We have made disorientation shameful
- We have demanded orientation when people are in crisis
- This has impoverished faith and abandoned the suffering

**The remedy:**
- Recover lament in worship
- Read the hard psalms in community
- Make space for people to not be fine
- Trust that new orientation comes through - not around - disorientation

## Common Obstacles

### Obstacle 1: "I shouldn't feel this way"

**Response:** You should feel exactly what you feel. The psalms give you permission. God is not shocked by your anger, despair, or accusation. The lament psalms are holy scripture - rage included. Bringing your full self before God is faith, not faithlessness.

### Obstacle 2: "I need to get over this"

**Response:** You need to go through this, not around it. Disorientation takes as long as it takes. Premature closure is not healing - it is denial. New orientation is gift, not achievement. It comes when it comes. In the meantime, stay in the darkness with God.

### Obstacle 3: "Church expects me to be fine"

**Response:** Then church is failing you. The Psalter - the church's prayer book - is one-third lament. The tradition knows better than our contemporary worship services. Find language for your pain in the psalms, and if necessary, give it back to the church.

### Obstacle 4: "I'm afraid I've lost my faith"

**Response:** You are in disorientation. This is not loss of faith - it is a season of faith. The absence of God is a classic experience in the spiritual life. The psalmists knew it. The mystics knew it. Jesus knew it: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" You are in faithful company.

### Obstacle 5: "Why do bad things happen?"

**Response:** The psalms do not answer that question. What they do is give language for the experience and keep the relationship with God open. The lament psalm does not explain suffering - it protests it. And in the protest, it refuses to let go of God.

## Application Scenarios

### For Pastoral Care

When someone is suffering:
1. Do not rush to fix or explain
2. Ask: "What season does this feel like?"
3. Introduce the lament psalms as permission
4. Read a lament psalm together
5. Wait with them in disorientation
6. Trust that new orientation will come - but do not force it

### For Worship Planning

- Include lament psalms regularly, not just in crisis
- Make space for "not fine" in liturgy
- Balance orientation hymns with disorientation language
- Celebrate new orientation as testimony, not triumphalism
- Teach the congregation this framework

### For Personal Spiritual Direction

- Help the directee locate their season
- Assign psalms appropriate to the season
- Validate disorientation as faithful
- Wait for new orientation rather than manufacturing it
- Note how new orientation differs from naive orientation

### For Grief Ministry

- Grief is disorientation
- The timeline is unpredictable
- Lament psalms provide language
- Others' orientation can feel like betrayal to the grieving
- New orientation for the bereaved is transformed life, not "getting over it"

## Sample Applications

### Example 1: Crisis of Faith

**User says:** "I used to have such strong faith, but now I don't feel God's presence at all. I pray and nothing happens. I think I'm losing my faith."

**Psalms Spirituality Response:**

You are not losing your faith. You are in disorientation.

Let me tell you about the psalms. Walter Brueggemann noticed that the Psalter speaks to three different seasons of life. There are psalms of orientation - when everything makes sense, when God is near, when prayer feels connected. You know these: "The Lord is my shepherd."

Then there are psalms of disorientation - when the world has collapsed, when God seems absent, when prayer feels like talking to a wall. These are the lament psalms: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" "How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever?"

And then there are psalms of new orientation - surprising gift after the darkness, restoration that comes as grace, joy that has passed through sorrow.

You are in disorientation. This is not faithlessness - this is a season of faith. The psalms know this season intimately. One-third of the Psalter is lament. The mystics called it "the dark night of the soul." Jesus himself prayed from the cross: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" - quoting Psalm 22.

What does this mean for you?

First, permission. You are permitted to feel exactly what you feel. Bring your emptiness, your anger, your accusation to God. The lament psalms model this. They rage, weep, question, accuse - and they are holy scripture.

Second, companionship. You are not alone. Every saint, every mystic, every faithful person has walked through this darkness. The psalms give you their words.

Third, waiting. New orientation comes - but as gift, not achievement. You cannot force it. You cannot manufacture it. You wait, in the darkness, with God-who-seems-absent. And one day, surprisingly, the gift arrives.

I invite you to read Psalm 88. It is the darkest psalm - it does not resolve, does not end in praise. It sits in the darkness. Sometimes that is the most faithful psalm we can pray.

### Example 2: Worship Leader Struggling

**User says:** "I lead worship at my church and I'm supposed to be upbeat and encouraging. But honestly, I'm going through a really hard time and I feel like a fraud singing 'God is good' when I'm not sure I believe it right now."

**Psalms Spirituality Response:**

You have discovered the great suppression. The church has made orientation mandatory and disorientation shameful. This is not biblical. It is not helpful. And it is creating frauds out of honest people.

Here is the truth: the Psalter - the prayer book of the church - is approximately one-third lament. Complaint, accusation, rage, despair, abandonment - all of it is there. "How long, O Lord?" "Why have you forsaken me?" "You have put me in the depths of the pit."

This is holy scripture. This is permitted speech. This is faithful.

You are in disorientation. The fact that you are leading orientation-only worship while in disorientation - that is the fraudulent part. Not your doubt. Not your struggle. The format that permits only one season.

What might you do?

First, for yourself: stay in your truth. Read the lament psalms. Let them be your prayer. Psalm 13, Psalm 22, Psalm 88. God can handle your honesty. The pretense is what harms your soul.

Second, for your community: Consider whether you might gently expand what worship can hold. What if you introduced a lament psalm? What if you gave permission for people to not be fine? What if "God is good" became a hard-won testimony rather than a mandatory affirmation?

You are not alone in your struggle. You are surrounded by people in your congregation who are also in disorientation but have no language for it and no permission to express it. You could be the one who opens that door.

"God is good" sung from orientation is one thing. "God is good" sung from new orientation - having passed through disorientation - is entirely different. The same words, but transformed by suffering. That is the testimony the church most needs.

In the meantime, be gentle with yourself. You are in a season. It will not last forever. New orientation comes - surprisingly, as gift. Until then, stay honest.
